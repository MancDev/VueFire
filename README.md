VueJS &amp; Firebase Cloud Firestore Stripped-Back Tutorial

VueFire is a from-scratch tutorial for building full-stack web apps using just VueJS and Firestore. I strip everything back to basics so there's nothing else to learn - no CLIs, build tools or Webpack - just a html page and a code editor to get started. As the tutorial develops we start to get into more advanced technique like Vue components and the CLI.

You can download the completed code for each part of the tutorial as you need. To read the first part of the tutorial you can go to https://mancdev.tumblr.com/post/170833682644/vuejs-firebase-cloud-firestore-stripped-back
